# Welcome to BlitCore

BlitCore is a set of tools & scripts to help speed up 2D game development in Unity3D.

A lot of work as been put into pixel perfect rendering for sprites, both when setting 
up camera and when moving objects around on the screen.

To use this in your Unity3D project and still be able to contribute back I recommend
the following setup:

1. Fork the repo to your GitHub account
2. Clone the repo into the `Assets` folder of your project
3. Exclude the cloned folder from your source game repo
4. Commit & push changes to the BlitCore repo to your fork
5. Send me a Pull Request from your fork

For this to work, do **NOT** add game specific scripts into the `BlitCore` scripts
folder.
